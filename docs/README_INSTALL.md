# Installation Guide

This document explains how to use the scripts safely.

## Preflight checks
- Ensure you have sudo privileges on Linux.
- On macOS, the installer will attempt to install Homebrew if missing (official upstream script).

## Running
- To install everything for this OS: `sudo scripts/install_all.sh`
- To run only the Ubuntu script: `sudo scripts/install_ubuntu.sh`
- To run only the macOS script: `scripts/install_macos.sh`

## Uninstall
Manual uninstall is recommended per-app (use distro package manager or Homebrew cask uninstall).
